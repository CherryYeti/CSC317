				<h3>About Me</h3>
				<p>
					Hello! I am a third year college student who believes in open source projects. I am majoring in computer science, and I love creating! I've been an avid linux user and advocate for the last 5 years, and I love working in Python and more recently, Zig (Arch BTW). I started making websites when I was around 12, and since, I have learned how to work in React and Svelte.<br/><br/> Other than websites, I have spent considerable time learning Jetpack Compose, a framework for building native apps for Android. I am one of the few people who loves writing documentation, as I find it extremely rewarding to make things easier for other people to understand.
