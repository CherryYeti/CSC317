# Portfolio Styling Assignment Analysis

## Analysis
For my hand written css, I originally started out with a more colorful, popping design, however, I hated the way it looked. I took some time and re-did all the coloring and organization of the elemtns in the css, making it more sleek/modern, rather than colorful. As of right now, rounded corners and glassy semi-transparent backgrounds seeme to be the current trend.

In terms of the AI css files, I found them to be very lacking in terms of quality. Even if they are more concise, they may miss a property or two, making the whole page seem incorrect. I think that the AI would do a much better job if it was given a base css file with some styling, and told to edit that file in order to acheive a desired outcome.


## Lessons Learned
I didn't learn a whole lot in terms of creating css, however, I leaned that the AI sucks at creating stylesheets for whatever reason. I also think that not being able to edit the html when creating the css really helped to push my creativity by setting limits.

## Preferred Version
I very much prefer my own version of the css, as the AI generated css files are incredibly basic in their styling.

The first prompt that I gave to the AI turned out much better than the second one, as the second one had incomplete/missing styling for almost all components.
