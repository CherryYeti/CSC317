## Review

When I saw the project, I immediately knew that I wanted to go for a tokenizer approach, as I had some experience parsing languages before (hyprlang). I found a nice figma mockup of the iOS calculator, since I do not own an iPhone, and "borrowed" some of the styling from there. Everything else I did from scratch

I perfer functional programming to object-oriented programming, so I defined a couple of global variables that would help me manage the state of the calculator. Getting the formatting for the display for the calculator right for a good ux was pretty difficult, but I'm happy with what I came up with.

Adding the project to my portfolio was not a very difficult task as I designed the website to be modular enought to be quickly editable. I did have to create some css for the image as none of my current projects listed have images.

This project was fun!
