## Review

This project was pretty fun. I had a good time learning how to work with new technologies, as well as practice my frontend skills. I'd never worked in ejs or mongodb before, so it was a little difficult to grasp at first, but once I understood everything, it became much easier.

The other thing I took away from this project was learning how to communicate as a group. Since we weren't always seeing each other, it was nice to have a good line of communication outside of class. We did this by creating a discord server that we all used pretty often to discuss things.

Awesome class!
